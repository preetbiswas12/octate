## 🌌 What Is Octate?

Octate is an **invisible overlay AI assistant** that sees your screen and helps you code in real-time. No context switching, no copy-pasting errors, no subscription fatigue.

It captures your workspace when you ask questions, understands your code visually, and responds like a developer who actually gets it—with wit, clarity, and zero corporate speak.

**Key Philosophy:**
- 🎯 **Context-aware** – sees what you see, no manual explanations needed
- 👻 **Invisible when needed** – toggle visibility instantly (perfect for screen sharing)
- 💰 **Free forever** – built by devs, for devs who deserve better
- 🧠 **Smart enough** – powered by Gemini 2.5 Flash with vision capabilities
- 🎭 **Personality included** – because debugging at 3am needs humor, not corporate blandness

## 🧩 Core Features

### 🕵️‍♂️ **Ghost Mode**
Vanish from screenshots and screen recordings instantly. Perfect for:
- Screen sharing in meetings
- Recording coding tutorials
- Pair programming sessions
- Privacy-conscious workflows

### 📸 **Visual Context Understanding**
Every question automatically includes a screenshot of your workspace:
- No more "let me paste 500 lines of code"
- AI sees your errors, stack traces, and UI issues
- Faster debugging with full visual context

### 🤖 **Gemini 2.5 Flash Vision**
Lightweight, fast, and surprisingly capable:
- Reads code from screenshots
- Understands error messages
- Analyzes UI layouts
- Spots bugs you've been staring at for hours

### ⌨️ **Hotkey-First Design**
Built for keyboard warriors:
- Zero mouse dependency
- Instant visibility toggle
- Quick-fire questions
- Panic quit when needed

### ♻️ **Token Regeneration**
When your API quota runs out:
- Generate new token
- Logout → Login
- Keep coding
- No credit card required

### 🎭 **Optional Roast Mode**
Because sometimes your code deserves honest feedback:
- Variable naming crimes
- Copy-paste forensics
- Architectural... choices
- Encouragement hidden in sarcasm

## ⚠️ Limitations

**Transparency matters. Here's what Octate can't do (yet):**

- 🪟 **Best on Windows** – Mac/Linux support is experimental
- 🤖 **Vision-dependent** – can only help with visible code/errors
- 🌐 **Requires internet** – offline mode in development
- 🎙️ **No voice** – keyboard/text only (by design, for privacy)
- 🔒 **API key needed** – you bring your own Gemini key (free tier available)

We're not pretending to be AGI. Octate is a focused tool that does one thing well: visual debugging assistance.

---

## 🛡️ Privacy & Ethics

### **What Octate Does:**
- ✅ Captures screenshots only when you ask questions
- ✅ Sends data directly to Google's Gemini API (your API key)
- ✅ Stores nothing on external servers
- ✅ Works offline for basic functions (no screenshots)

### **What Octate Doesn't Do:**
- ❌ Record your microphone
- ❌ Track your browsing
- ❌ Send telemetry to third parties
- ❌ Store your code on our servers (we don't have servers)

### **Responsible Use:**
Octate is designed as a **learning and productivity tool**. It's your responsibility to:
- Follow your organization's AI usage policies
- Respect academic integrity in educational settings
- Use assistive features ethically in professional contexts
- Understand that AI helps you learn, not think for you

## 🎓 The Octate Philosophy

**We believe:**
1. Developer tools should be accessible, not paywalled
2. Privacy is a feature, not an afterthought
3. AI should assist learning, not replace thinking
4. Software can be powerful AND have personality
5. The best debugger is the one that's always there

**We reject:**
1. Subscription fatigue culture
2. "Productivity surveillance" disguised as assistance
3. Corporate blandness in developer tools
4. Feature bloat over core functionality
5. Gatekeeping AI behind enterprise pricing

## 📜 License

MIT License (when open sourced) – use it, fork it, make it better.

Until then, free for personal and commercial use. Just don't resell it as "CloudAI DevAssist Pro" for $49/mo. We'll know. We'll judge.
