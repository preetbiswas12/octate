# 🌌 What Is Octate?

Octate is an **invisible overlay AI sidekick** for devs who don’t want to:

- Sell their soul to Cluely, InterviewCoder, or whatever overpriced SaaS startup crawled out of the VC swamp.  
- Be spied on by “productivity AI” apps that think reading your mic = helping you.  
- Cry alone when code refuses to compile at 3am.  

It sees your screen, screenshots when you chat, and answers like a witty ghost.  
No mic spying. No subscription scams. No cult-like “community Slack”.  

Just **screenshots + invisibility + insults + debugging**.  
Simple. Efficient. A little unhinged.

# 🧩 Features (aka Why You’ll Love It)

- 🕵️‍♂️ **Invisibility Mode** – vanishes from screenshots faster than your self-esteem after a failed coding test.  
- 📸 **Auto-Screenshots** – every chat = proof of your coding crimes delivered to AI.  
- 🤖 **AI Vision** – powered by **Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite (Vision)**, a.k.a. “Diet GPT with eyeballs.”  
- 🚪 **Logout Button** – eject yourself when Octate has judged you enough.  
- 🆘 **Help Button** – won’t fix your trauma, but gives you the right way.
- ⌨️ **Hotkeys Everywhere** – because who actually clicks buttons in 2025?
- ♻️ **Token Respawn** – when your token dies, regenerate a new one → logout → login → congrats, you just respawned. Infinite lives, dude.
- 🎭 **Roast Mode** – AI can roast your code, your naming conventions, and occasionally, you.

# ⚔️ Why Not Use Cluely or InterviewCoder?

Because those apps are basically pay-to-win cosmetics for ChatGPT.

| App | What They Do | Why They’re Mid | Why Octate Laughs |
|-----|--------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Cluely** | Invisible AI for meetings | Costs $20, spies on your mic, corporate boring | Octate is free, mute, and funny |
| **InterviewCoder** | Overlay for coding interviews | Subscriptions, feature bloat, sometimes buggy | Octate is stripped down, screenshot-only, stealthy |
| **Octate** | Invisible debugger sidekick | Free, sarcastic, token-respawn hack | 🏆 Winner: does less, costs nothing, feels better |

Octate is basically if you threw Cluely + InterviewCoder into a blender, deleted the capitalism, and sprinkled in caffeine + gallows humor.

# 🚧 Roadmap (aka Stuff I Might Add If I Don’t Burn Out)

- 💀 **Roast Pack DLC** – customizable insult intensity (from “mild roast” to “nuclear devastation”).
- 🧙 **Invisibility 2.0** – vanishes not just from screenshots but from your will to exist.
- 🔗 **Plugin System** – let Octate roast your friends’ code too.  
- 📦 **Offline AI Mode** – so you can code in a bunker without internet.

---

# ⚠️ Limitations (aka Lower Your Expectations)

- 🪟 Runs best on **Windows**. Mac/Linux users are free but more than just beta-testers in eternal suffering.  
- 🤖 Powered by Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite – don’t expect it to build Skynet.
- 💻 Can only debug what it sees. If your bug is in your soul, sorry.  
- 🚫 Voice Mode? Nah. If you want karaoke, go cry to Spotify.

# ⌨️ Hotkeys

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|---------|
| <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Space</kbd> | Toggle invisibility faster than hiding your weird tabs. |
| <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd> | Beg AI for answers. |
| <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>B</kbd> | Invisible like your Partner's interest in your code. |
| <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Q</kbd> | Octate is tired from you so it quits. |
| <kbd>Esc</kbd> | Panic quit before your manager sees. |

# 🎭 FAQ (Frequently Avoided Questions)

- **Q: Is it detectable?**  
  A: Only if your boss is Batman with screen-diff software. Otherwise, you’re good.  

- **Q: Is this free?**  
  A: Yes. Keep your $20. Spend it on ramen and therapy.  

- **Q: What happens when my token dies?**  
  A: You regen a new one, logout, login, and boom—reborn. Infinite loop. Like Jesus, but for API keys.  

- **Q: Is it stable?**  
  A: As stable as your sleep schedule.  

- **Q: Can Octate do interviews for me?**  
  A: No, but it’ll roast you while you bomb them. Character building.

Until then, think of it as a **closed beta for the chronically online**.
